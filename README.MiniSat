Since NuSMV version 2.3.1 MiniSAT [1] is the default SAT solver. When
not available, the default SAT solver will be SIM, as in previous
versions.

For information about how to compile and use MiniSAT within NuSMV, and
for other important information about MiniSAT, please refer to the
file <NuSMV-(version)/MiniSat/README>.
